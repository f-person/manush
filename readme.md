============

there are two ways to build manush.

first is by using vipack package manager.

just issue the following in this directory:

```
vipack -t `pwd`/deptree -p manush -P `pwd`
```

vipack should download all the necessary dependencies and build manush.

then you will find the resulting binary in `build` directory.

second way to build manush is by using the supplied makefile.
